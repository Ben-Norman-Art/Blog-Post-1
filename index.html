<p class="Group" style="color:white"> The game that I chose from the Internet Arcade was the Simpsons Arcade game. While playing I was easily able to tell that the game was working at a better frames per seconds. I wasn’t able to choose the character I actually liked so I decided to play a different character. The controllers were quite difficult, the keys were really close to each other. Most of the time it was me walking or jumping away from enemies. The coin system was also confusing and due to that I made two characters appear and had to move them both in order for them not to lose health. When comparing the emulator and the actual arcade game, the first thing I noticed was the fact that when doing the attack button the character would instantly lock on to the enemy closest to them. Compared to the actual arcade game where you would have to use the joystick towards the exact enemy you would like to attack. While playing I was easily able to tell that the game was working at a better frames per seconds. Another difference is in the emulator a character/player could spam the attack button, a player could do that in the arcade game too, but the difference is the time frame between attacks is much faster in the emulator than in the arcade. I was able to fight bosses just simply continuously spamming the attack button and they wouldn’t be able to do anything. It makes the game way too easy to play, I was able to get through to level 5 within only a few minutes.
